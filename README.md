Testing and Continuous Integration Web Crawler/Scraper project.
1.2 Project description

The WCA is required to have three main functionalities:

1. To be able to crawl the whole site, given a ‘base’ address. The WCA-REST result is a JSON response containing all the details about:

      • Movies

          ◦ Genre, Format, Year, Director, Writers, Stars

      • Music

          ◦ Genre, Format, Year, Artist

      • Books

          ◦ Genre, Format, Year, Authors, Publisher, ISBN

2. To be able to crawl the site until a given movie/music/book is found. Also in this case a ‘base address’ should be given. If found, the details of such should be returned. If not found, an empty JSON response is to be returned.

3. To be able to get the data about a specific crawling action (determined by, for example, an unique id). Specifically the data about it

should be: 
      • Strategy Used (could be DFS or BFS)

      • Number of pages explored

      • Time elapsed

      • Search depth

You are to work in a 3 people team. Across the block you are required to:

  • Make pull requests;

  • Integrate your work with the others through code reviews (GitHub and live);

  • Make use of a CI system running. That should:

      ◦ Be triggered by successful pull requests to ‘master’ branch

      ◦ Trigger back GitHub to allow approving a pull request after code reviews (and only when the build succeeded)

      ◦ Should run regression unit tests automatically after changes to the ‘master’ branch have been made

In general, every student must take part into the code review and development of each single part of the application.

1.4 Delivery date

Your assignment should be ready at the beginning of week 8 - Monday 9.00 am.

It is up to you to manage your time and bring improvements to the software and its testing. If not submitted on time, the maximum achievable grade is going to be 1.

If personal/health related problems prevent you from submitting your work on time, let the lecturer know as soon as possible. In this case, the exam board will decide on impact on your course.

1.5 Deliverables

➔ WCA to crawl ‘media library’ site (see specification in project description) *.

➔ Show an overview of needed classes, their responsibility and dependencies. (f.i. as a C4 component diagram or UML class diagram). You don’t need to specify methods here, only responsibilities and dependencies, since this gives an impression of how many tests are needed. (overview needs to be submitted before Monday 8.00 am in week 6) ***.

➔ WCA-REST API *.

➔ Stress Test report using the WCA-REST API with short reflections for each part **.

➔ Demo of use of the CI environment.

➔ Reflection on choice of which search method is used.

* = To be submitted as a zipped project as well as a link to project repo ***.

** = To be submitted as a zipped HTML report (generated by a software such as JMeter) together with a .pdf document to explain each generated chart and section.

*** = To be submitted as a pdf document.
